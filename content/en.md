The Constitution protects everyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status.

- You have the right to refuse searches (4th Amendment)
- You have the right to an attorney (6th Amendment)

## If You Are Arrested

Stay calm and do not resist. Ask for a lawyer immediately.

- Do not answer questions without a lawyer present

- Write down everything you remember as soon as possible

## Immigration (ICE) Encounters

You have rights even if you are undocumented.
